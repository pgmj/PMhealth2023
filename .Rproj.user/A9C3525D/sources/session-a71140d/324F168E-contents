## Agenda {background-color="#009ca6"}

-   a brief background of the package
    -   reproducibility, transparency & quality
-   walkthrough of Quarto/R code and its output
    -   using the package vignette as an example (available online)

### Useful links - github.com/pgmj

-   this presentation: <https://github.com/pgmj/PMhealth2023>
-   the RISEkbmRasch package: <https://github.com/pgmj/RISEkbmRasch>
-   vignette for the package: <https://pgmj.github.io/raschrvignette/RaschRvign.html>
-   intro course to Rstudio & Quarto: [https://github.com/pgmj/RstudioQuartoIntro](https://github.com/pgmj/RstudioQuartoIntro#introduction-to-reproducible-data-analysis-with-r-and-quarto)

## Why R?

-   open source & free
-   potentially easier for others to reproduce and learn from your results
-   available for Windows/Mac/Linux/etc

### But...

Plots and other output still needs copying to a text document to collect the output and document the analysis

-   challenging to reproduce results
    -   especially if you go back to an old project

### Quarto

<https://quarto.org>

-   documentation in the same document as the analysis code!
-   can output PDF, Word, HTML documents (and more)
-   makes reproducibility simple
-   (yes, it is like Rmarkdown)
-   pre-installed with Rstudio

## Brief history {background-color="#009ca6"}

-   I tried ordering RUMM but didn't get a response
-   Took a course on IRT/CAT with R
-   Created code to recreate/develop output of Winsteps/RUMM
  -   Workshop with colleagues
    -   *"Maybe make functions to simplify?"*

### What is an R package?

- a collection of `functions()`
- `RISEkbmRasch` relies 100% on other packages
  - it can be described as a "wrapper" package
  - it is also an "opinionated" package

### Package ambitions

-   **make it as simple as possible to get key tables and figures**
-   you can choose cut-off values for highlighting in most functions, for instance:
    -   item fit over/under a certain value
    -   residual correlations relative to average residual correlations
-   more flexibility gradually added (but also adds complexity)

## Notes on choices

There are multiple R packages for Rasch analysis.

-   We went with `eRm` primarily
    -   handles dichotomous and polytomous data
    -   uses CML, conditional maximum likelihood
        -   "specific objectivity"
        -   ordinal sum score as a "sufficient metric"
-   `mirt` for Yen's Q3 residuals
-   `psychotree` for DIF (differential item functioning)

### Simulation study coming

Partial credit model (PCM) analysis

-   `eRm` with CML
-   `TAM` with MML

Comparisons with variation in sample size and targeting. May also produce a reasonable basis for assessing power for Rasch analysis. R code will be included.

## What's in the package? {background-color="#009ca6"}

-   Descriptive analysis
    -   distribution of data
    -   missing data
    -   Guttman "heatmap"

### Required data structure

-   one dataframe with **item data ONLY**
    -   coded as integers starting with 0 for lowest response category
-   one dataframe with item descriptions
-   (DIF variables as separate vectors)

### Rasch-related functions

-   Let's go to Rstudio and the sample code from the package vignette
    -   **all code is available on GitHub**

## Benefits {background-color="#009ca6"}

-   you can make a template analysis file
    -   makes it harder to miss important steps
        -   quality assurance
-   easier for others to understand your analysis process, step by step
    -   easier for yourself to go back to old analyses...
-   transparency in decision making
-   complete reproducibility if data is shared

## A note on templates

Our group at RISE have made an analysis template based on our preprint, in which we propose a reporting standard for psychometric analyses. It builds on Tennant & Conaghan's 2007 paper and others.
